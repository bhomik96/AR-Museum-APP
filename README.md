<b>AR-Museum-APP</b><br>
This is an augmented reality app based on museum artifacts.
Augmented reality (AR) can be defined as the overlaying of digital content (images, video, text, sound, etc.) onto physical objects or locations, and it is typically experienced by looking through the camera lens of an electronic device such as a smartphone, tablet, or optical head-mounted display (e.g. Microsoft Hololens).<br><br>
In this project,an android application for mobile devices was made which shows museum artifacts 3d models from phone lens when it detects marker of that artifact i.e. picture of that artifact. This app can be helpful for viewing the artifacts 3-D model properly and remotely just by looking at their picture from home also.<br><br>
In this project,
Marker Based Augmented Reality (also called Image Recognition) is used with visual marker, such as a 2d image of that artifact, to produce a result only when the marker is sensed by a reader. Marker based applications use a camera on the device to distinguish a marker from any other real world object. The App was made using Unity and Vuforia as database for artifacts models and compiled to generate <b>ar2.apk file.</b><br>

The app upon detecting images of artifacts superimposes 3d models of them on the screen of phone which user can view from different angles and rotate the model 360 degrees to have an immersive viewing experience.
<br><br>
Moreover the app also shows information about the artifact after showing its model i.e. it displays its history and other trivia to the user on the phone screen which gives an experience similar to viewing models in museums.<br><br>
Since this is a prototype made for educative purpose the app currently have database of 3-4 artifacts only, but more models can be added to the app easily.
